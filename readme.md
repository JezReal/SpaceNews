# SpaceNews

SpaceNews is an Android app you can use to easily read about the latest events about space and spaceflight.
Built using the [Spaceflight News API](https://spaceflightnewsapi.net).


## Architecture and libraries used

The architecture for this app is MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) which is the recommended way for building Android apps

The libraries that I used are:
- Coroutines + Flow
- ViewModel
- Hilt
- Navigation component
- Retrofit + Moshi
- Glide
